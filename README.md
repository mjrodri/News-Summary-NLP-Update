# News-Summary-NLP-Update
Refresh Functionality:

Old Version: The initial version lacked a mechanism to refresh the interface after summarization.
Updated Version: A "Refresh" button (btn_refresh) has been added, allowing users to clear the interface and enter new URLs without restarting the application.
Enhanced Code Structure:

Old Version: The code was structured as a single function without a modular approach.
Updated Version: The code has been organized into two main functions (summarize and refresh), improving readability and maintainability.
Improved User Interaction:

Old Version: The initial version relied solely on the "Summarize" button, which presented limitations for users who wanted to input multiple articles successively.
Updated Version: The introduction of the "Refresh" button enhances user experience by providing a convenient way to clear the interface for new inputs.
Code Comments:

Old Version: Lacked comments for code explanation and understanding.
Updated Version: Added comments to explain key sections of the code, making it more accessible for developers and contributors.
Additional Documentation:

Old Version: The initial description lacked specific details about the code structure and features.
Updated Version: The extended README now provides a comprehensive overview, key tools, skills, features, and how to use the application.
Button Styling:

Old Version: Basic buttons with default styling.
Updated Version: Buttons have been given more descriptive names (btn_summarize and btn_refresh) and are positioned using the side attribute.

These improvements aim to make the code more user-friendly, modular, and maintainable, promoting better interaction with the news summarization application.
